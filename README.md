# 461-work
Repository consisting of majority of my experience with C, Operating Systems, and Scripting.

## What this repository contains
This repository consists of my work done in my Applied Operating Systems course where we used a Linux VM to do all of our labs/assignments.

## What I learned
In this course, I learned a plethora of OS concepts starting with what an OS is and its purpose. We learned about Virtualization, How memory works, Scripting with Linux, Pagination and TLB caches, Scheduling and different Scheduling policies such as Round Robin and FIFO (First in First out), enforced our fundamental knowledge of C.

## Where to find code
The assignments above only have the required code needed for submission which sometimes does not include everything that was done. To find the source code and view commits, contributions, etc. please look for repositories in my profile that contain the code 461 in the name like ENSF461-Lab05 or something of the sort.
